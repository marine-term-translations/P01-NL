  original: Measurements made by isotope-doped short incubation experiment followed
    by counting of particulates collected on a 0.2um pore filter filtering water previously
    filtered by 2um pore filter. Light-level not specified by the parameter code.
    Rate normalised by dividing the total uptake by the incubation duration in hours.
