    original: "The dissolved excess Th-230 concentration refers to the measured dissolved Th-230 corrected for a contribution of Th-230 due to the partial dissolution of uranium-bearing minerals, or lithogenics. Thereby the dissolved excess represents solely the fraction of Th-230 produced in the water by decay of dissolved uranium-234. The lithogenic Th-230 has been estimated using measuring dissolved Th-232 and a lithogenic Th-230/Th-232 ratio of 4.0e-6 (atom ratio) as determined by Roy-Barman et al. (2002) and a conversion factor to convert picomoles to micro-Becquerels."
