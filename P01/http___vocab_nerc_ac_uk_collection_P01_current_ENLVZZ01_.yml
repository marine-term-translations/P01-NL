    original: "A measure of the intensity of echo return from an altimeter. Energy level ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 represents full saturation of the receiver. An energy level of 0.707 (square root of 2) is the theoretical perfect level as it represents the energy of a pure sine wave with an amplitude utilising the maximum dynamic range of the receiver."
