    original: "The isotope ratio of 138Ba/134Ba in a sample of fresh or salt water body after removal of particles larger than 0.4 or 0.45 micron relative to the NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology) for barium (SRM 3104a) and expressed using the delta notation defined as delta(138/134Ba)NIST =([138Ba/134Ba]sample/[138Ba/134Ba]NIST)-1)Ã—1000. One delta unit represents a one part per 1,000 deviation from the NIST standard composition."
