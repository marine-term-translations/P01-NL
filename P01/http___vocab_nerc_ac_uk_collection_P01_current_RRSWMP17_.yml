  original: The water-leaving radiance at the specified wavelength, Lw(λ), corrected
    for bidirectional effects of the air-sea interface and sub-surface light field,
    and normalised by downwelling solar irradiance, Ed(λ), just above the sea surface
    (Franz, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center), as predicted by a numerical model.
