    original: "Concentration of barium in suspended particles by Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) on acid leachate (0.4/0.45um pore filtered). The total particulate Ba content was corrected for lithogenic Ba. Corrected Ba is called excess or biogenic Ba (Baxs) and usually represents >95 percent of total Ba."
