    original: "The rate at which water flows vertically upwards in the water column, measured using the resultant horizontal and vertical velocity components from beams 1 and 3 of an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP). Used as an assessment of data quality when compared with the same measurements from beams 2 and 4."
