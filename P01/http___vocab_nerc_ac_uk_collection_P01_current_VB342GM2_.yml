    original: "Deviation of the 138Ba/134Ba isotopic ratio of a sample of fresh or salt water after removal of particles larger than 0.2 micron relative to the standard solution SRM 3104a, a reference material for Barium (Ba) developed by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, defined as delta(138/134Ba)NIST =([138Ba/134Ba]sample/[138Ba/134Ba]NIST)-1)Ã—1000. One delta unit represents a one part per 1,000 deviation from the NIST standard composition."
