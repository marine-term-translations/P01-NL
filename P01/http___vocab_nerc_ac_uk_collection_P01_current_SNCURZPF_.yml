    original: "Measurements made by radiotracer doped, constant light incubation at 188 uE/m2/s with antibiotic, followed by counting particulates collected on a 0.2um pore filter filtering water previously filtered through a 2um pore filter. Rate normalised by dividing the total uptake by the incubation duration in hours."
