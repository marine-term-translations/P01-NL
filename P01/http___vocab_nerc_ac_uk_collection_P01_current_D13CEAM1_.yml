    original: "Enrichment of 13C relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard (also referred to as delta-13C) in organic carbon from a body of salt or fresh water and retained on a GF/F filter. Combustion step may occur within elemental analyser if linked to mass spectrometer. Measurement is either a single determination or the average of replicates."
