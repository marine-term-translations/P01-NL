  original: The magnitude of the normalised echo autocorrelation from the vertical
    beam (sometimes known as the 5th beam) of a 5-beam ADCP, after range gating of
    the data into individual depth cells, at the lag used for estimating the Doppler
    phase shift. Used in determining confidence in the data, beam by beam and cell
    by cell. Values are represented on a linear 8-bit scale between 0 and 255, where
    255 is a perfect correlation.
