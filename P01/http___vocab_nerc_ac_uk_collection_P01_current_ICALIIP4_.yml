    original: "Depth integration of measurements made by isotope-doped incubation experiments followed by counting the particulates on each filter of a filter cascade down to a 0.2um pore filter. Individual depth values obtained by summing the size-fractionated data.  Incubation conditions not specified by parameter code."
