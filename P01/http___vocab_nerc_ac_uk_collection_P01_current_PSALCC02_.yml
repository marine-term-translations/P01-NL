    original: "CTD measurement of salinity that is known to have been calibrated against independent salinity measurements such as salinometer determinations on bottle samples. This is the alternative term for this definition.  Only use to cover cases where there are two sensors of the same type contributing to the data set and referential integrity considerations prevent a usage of a single code."
