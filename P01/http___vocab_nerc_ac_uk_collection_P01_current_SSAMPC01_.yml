    original: "A decimal coefficient lower or equal to 1 that indicates the proportion of the sample that is represented in the sub-sample. This value allows to rescale the counted (and measured) individuals to the total sampling effort applied at sample level. If no proportional subsampling occurred this value should equal 1."
