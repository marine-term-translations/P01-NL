    original: "Number of particles in a unit volume of any body of fresh or salt water resolved by flow cytometry as undifferentiated eukaryotic cells in an operationally defined nanoplankton size range; this code should only be used when referring to total (i.e. photosynthetic plus heterotrophic) nanoeukaryotes in this size range or when it is not known whether the counts refer to DNA-stained or autofluorescent cells; for eukaryotic nanophytoplankton (i.e. cells with natural fluorescence) use ANA07969."
