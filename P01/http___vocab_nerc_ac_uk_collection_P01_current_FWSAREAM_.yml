    original: "A flow cytometry parameter defined as the midpoint value of the distribution of the areas under the forward light scatter curve of individual particles belonging to a same cluster (or group) defined by a region. The Forward light scatter (FWS) corresponds to the amount of photons scattered in a frontal angle by a particle when crossing a laser beam."
