    original: "A coded label published in Rowles et al (2001) indicating the stage of decomposition (condition code) of one or more specimens of a marine mammal (identified elsewhere in the data or metadata) in the sample or observation. This may refer to a single individual if the sample count is one. Possible values are code 1 = live stranding, code 2 = fresh dead stranding, code 3 = moderate decomposition, code 4 = advanced decomposition, and code 5 = mummified carcass or skeleton.
