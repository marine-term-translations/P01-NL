  original: The isotope ratio of 143Nd/144Nd in a unit mass of fresh or salt water
    after removal of particles larger than 0.4 or 0.45 micron, expressed using the
    epsilon notation defined as Epsilon(Nd) = ( ( ([143Nd/144Nd]sample / [143Nd/144Nd]CHUR)-1
    ) x 10000 ). One epsilon unit represents a one part per 10,000 deviation from
    the CHUR composition.
