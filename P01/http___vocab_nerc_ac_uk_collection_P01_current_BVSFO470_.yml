    original: "The radiant intensity of scattered light from the water body as a function of angle, measured at the specified wavelength by an in-situ optical backscattering instrument. Volume scattering coefficient (Beta) is calculated by subtracting dark counts from the raw counts then multiplying by the manufacturer-supplied calibration scale factor."
