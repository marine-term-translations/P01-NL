    original: "The amount (moles or mass) of nitrogen in any chemical forms contained in particulate material present in a water sample and retained on a 53 um filter. This quantity is sometimes labelled "PON" for Particulate Organic Nitrogen (i.e. nitrogen in compounds containing carbon atoms) when assumption is made that inorganic nitrogen content in suspended particulate material is zero or negligible."
