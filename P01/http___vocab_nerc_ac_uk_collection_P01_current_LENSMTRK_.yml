    original: "The angular (haversine) distance of the route along which a sample was collected or an observation was made, such as a beach transect, the track of a sampling net through water, or the track of a benthic sampler along the seafloor. It can also include the angular (haversine) distance of the passage or transit between sampling or observation locations."
