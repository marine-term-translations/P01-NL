    original: "Measurements made by radiotracer doped constant light incubation at 188 uE/m2/s followed by counting of particulates collected on a 0.2um pore filter filtering water previously filtered through a 2um pore filter. Rates normalised by dividing total uptake by incubation duration in hours."
