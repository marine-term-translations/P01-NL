  original: The concentration of the specified analyte in sediment pore water passed
    through a 0.2um filter. The analytical method of inductively-coupled plasma atomic
    emission spectroscopy is also sometimes referred to as inductively-coupled plasma
    optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).
