    original: "A computationally convenient approximation (root mean square wave height in sampling period multiplied by 4) to significant wave height. Significant wave height is a statistic computed from wave measurements that correspond to the average height of the highest one third of the waves, where wave height is defined as the vertical distance from a wave trough to the following wave crest."
