    original: "The number of breeding pairs or occupied territories of a given species in a given area. This number is determined by standardized interpretation of several types of territory-indicative behavior (song, pair bond, alarm, nest, etc.) observed during several visits to the survey area. The number of visits depends on habitat and species selection (all species or a fixed selection of rare or scarce species)."
