    original: "Number of particles in a unit volume of any body of fresh or salt water resolved by flow cytometry as undifferentiated eukaryotic phytoplankton in a size range operationally defined as nanoplankton; this code can be used for counts labelled 'eukaryotic nanophytoplankton'; 'photosynthetic or phototrophic nanoflagellates'; 'plastidic nanoeukaryotes'; etc.; or when it is known that the counts were obtained using natural fluorescence (i.e. no stain was used) and the cells were referred to as 'nanoeukaryotes' or 'nanoflagellates'."
