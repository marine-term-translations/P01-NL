    original: "The mean magnitude of the normalised echo autocorrelation from beams 1-4 of an ADCP, after range gating of the data into individual depth cells, at the lag used for estimating the Doppler phase shift. Used in determining confidence in the data, beam by beam and cell by cell. Values are represented as a percentage from 0 to 100 percent, where 100 percent is a perfect correlation."
