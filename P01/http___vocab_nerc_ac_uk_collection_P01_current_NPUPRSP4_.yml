    original: "Measurements made by radiotracer doped incubation in full natural sunlight followed by counting particulates collected on each filter of a filter cascade down to a 0.2um pore filter. Rate normalised by dividing the total uptake by the incubation duration in hours. Total value obtained by summing size-fractionated data."
