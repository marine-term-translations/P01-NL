    original: "The amount (quantity or mass) of the manganese in all oxidation states released from a subsample of bulk (unsieved) sediment following leaching treatment with ascorbic acid and analysis of the leachate by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. This sediment solid phase leach treatment releases loosely held and easily reducible iron but does not release crystalline oxides (see e.g. Raiswell et al 2010 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2010.09.002)."
