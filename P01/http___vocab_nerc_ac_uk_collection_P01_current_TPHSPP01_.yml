    original: "The amount (mass or moles) of total phosphorus (i.e.phosphorus in all chemical forms) measured in a unit volume of unfiltered sea water sample following oxidation and analysis as phosphate using colorimetric autoanalysis. The result can only be considered equivalent to total dissolved phosporus (TDP) if the contribution from the particulate pool is assumed to be negligible."
