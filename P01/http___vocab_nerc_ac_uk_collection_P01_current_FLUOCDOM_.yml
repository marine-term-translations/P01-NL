    original: "This code is under review due to its ambiguity. It is likely to be deprecated at the end of the review period. Please use terms stating 'Concentration of%' for calibrated CDOM fluorometer output or 'Raw signal% of%' for the raw fluorescence signal [updated 30/07/2019]. Definition was: The amount of violet to low ultra-violet radiation generated in the water column in response to high ultra-violet radiation transmission expressed relative to an unspecified baseline using fluorometer designed to detect CDOM, crude oil or UV-fluorescent dyes."
