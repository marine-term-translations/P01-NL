    original: "The difference in the proportion of 15N isotope between the nitrogen in the residue of a GF/F filtered sample of water from any fresh or salt water body and a reference standard. Acidification step is due to concurrent elemental analysis and IR-MS of both particulate C and N. Combustion step may occur within elemental analyser linked to mass spectrometer. Measurement is either a single determination or the average of replicates."
