    original: "Number of coralligenous colonies (that is multi-species assemblages made of gorgonian, coral, sponge, and bryozoan species) with a percentage of necrosis equal to or greater than 10% of the living area of the colony, and expressed as a proportion relative to the total number of colonies observed in the surveyed population. Generally expressed as a percentage, this is a parameter used to evaluate the conservation status of the coralligenous habitats."
