    original: "Measurements made by radiotracer doped incubation followed by counting particulates collected on each filter of a cascade down to a 0.2um pore filter. Rate normalised by dividing the total uptake by the incubation duration in hours and size-fractionated values summed to give the total.  Light level not specified by parameter code."
