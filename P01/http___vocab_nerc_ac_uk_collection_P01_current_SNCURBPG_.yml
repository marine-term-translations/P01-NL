  original: Measurements made by radiotracer doped experiment, constant light incubation
    at 188 uE/m2/s, followed by counting of particulates collected on a 2um pore filter
    filtering water previously filtered through a 20um pore filter. Rate normalised
    by dividing the total uptake by the incubation duration in hours.
