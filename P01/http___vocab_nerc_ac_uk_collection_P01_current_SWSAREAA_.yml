    original: "A flow cytometry parameter defined as the sum of the areas under the sideward light scatter curve of individual particles belonging to a same cluster (or group) defined by a region, divided by the number of particles in the cluster. The Sideward light Scatter (SWS) corresponds to the amount of photons scattered at 90 degrees to the laser beam direction by a particle when crossing a laser beam."
