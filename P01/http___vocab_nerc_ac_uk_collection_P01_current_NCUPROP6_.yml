    original: "Measurements made by radiotracer doped on-deck incubations at simulated in-situ light level followed by counting particulates collected on each filter of a filter cascade down to a GF/F filter. Rates normalised by dividing the total uptake by the incubation duration in hours and total value obtained by summing size-fractionated data."
