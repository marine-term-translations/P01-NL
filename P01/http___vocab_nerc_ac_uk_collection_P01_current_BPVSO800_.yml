    original: "Code deprecated on 05/03/2024: created in error. Definition was: The radiant intensity of scattered light from particles in the water body as a function of angle, with the scattering contribution of pure seawater removed, measured at the specified wavelength by an in-situ optical backscattering instrument. Beta(p) is determined by calculating the volume scattering of pure seawater and removing it from the total volume scattering coefficient (Beta) to yield the volume scattering attributable to particles only."
