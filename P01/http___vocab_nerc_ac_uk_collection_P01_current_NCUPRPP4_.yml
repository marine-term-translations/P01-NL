    original: "Measurements made by radiotracer doped azide poisoned control incubation at 100 uE/m2/s followed by counting particulates collected on each filter of a filter cascade down to a 0.2um pore filter. Rates normalised by dividing the total uptake by the incubation duration in hours and total value obtained by summing size-fractionated data."
