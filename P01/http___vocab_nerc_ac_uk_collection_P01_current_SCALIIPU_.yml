    original: "Measurements made by isotope-doped incubation experiment followed by counting particulates collected on a 0.2um pore filter filtering water previously filtered through a 5um pore filter.  Filters counted before and after acidification to give calcification by difference. Parameter code holds no information on incubation light level."
