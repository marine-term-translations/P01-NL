  original: Measurements made by radiotracer and antibiotic doped constant light incubation
    at 188 uE/m2/s followed by counting of particulates collected on a 0.2um pore
    filter filtering water previously filtered through a 2um pore filter. Rates normalised
    by dividing total uptake by incubation duration in hours.
