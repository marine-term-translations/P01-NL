    original: "CTD measurement of temperature that is known to have been checked and if necessary calibrated against independent measurements such as reversing thermometer measurements. This is the alternative term for this definition.  Only use to cover cases where there are two sensors of the same type contributing to the data set and referential integrity considerations prevent a usage of a single code."
