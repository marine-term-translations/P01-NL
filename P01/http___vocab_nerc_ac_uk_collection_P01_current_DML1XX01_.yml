    original: "A standard size measurement in coleoid cephalopod morphometry. It is the length measured in a straight line over the dorsal midline of the mantle (or dorsal mantle length, DML), i.e. the cephalopod's "body" lying posterior to the head. A different P01 code needs to be used whenever for ventral mantle length is reported."
