    original: "The isotope ratio of 143Nd/144Nd in particulate material suspended in a fresh or salt water body and retained by a 0.8 micron filter, expressed using the epsilon notation defined as Epsilon(Nd) = ( ( ([143Nd/144Nd]sample / [143Nd/144Nd]CHUR)-1 ) x 10000 ). One epsilon unit represents a one part per 10,000 deviation from the CHUR composition."
