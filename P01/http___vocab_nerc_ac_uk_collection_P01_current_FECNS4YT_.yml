    original: "The amount (quantity or mass) of the iron in all oxidation states released from a subsample of bulk (unsieved) sediment with citrate dithionate leach following leacing with ascorbic acid to remove the more labile forms of the analyte, and analysis of the leachate by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. This sediment solid phase leach treatment releases moderately reducible crystalline oxide forms (see e.g. Raiswell et al 2010 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2010.09.002)."
