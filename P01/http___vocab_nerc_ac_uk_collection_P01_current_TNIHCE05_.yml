  original: The backscattering strength of a returning acoustic signal transmitted
    by the vertical beam (sometimes known as the 5th beam) of a 5-beam ADCP. It is
    dependent on the presence of scatterers such as particles, bubbles or organisms
    in the water body as well as the acoustic frequency of the ADCP.
