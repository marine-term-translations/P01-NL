    original: "The quantity of the optically measurable component of coloured (chromophoric) dissolved organic matter (CDOM) that fluoresces when excited with near ultra-violet (UV) light, measured in a unit volume of any body of fresh or salt water by an in-situ fluorometer and calibrated against a quinine sulphate proxy. Often referred to as fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) when expressed as quinine sulphate equivalent."
