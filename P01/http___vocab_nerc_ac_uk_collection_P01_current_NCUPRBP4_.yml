    original: "Measurements made by radiotracer doped constant light incubation at 188 uE/m2/s followed by counting particulates collected on each filter of a filter cascade down to a 0.2um pore filter. Rates normalised by dividing the total uptake by the incubation duration in hours and the total value obtained by summing the size-fractionated data.."
