  original: Estimate of the total particle volume concentration in the particle sizer's
    size range of 1 to 500 micron, using near real-time processing methods. These
    are approximate quantities, not as accurate as values derived from the fully-processed
    particle size distribution. They are useful for a quick characterization of the
    water conditions.
